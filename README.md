## Parser

- We shall only deal with integers, symbols, functions, and list.

- Haskell comes standard with a parsing library called ```Parsec``` which implements a domain specific language for parsing text.

- To learn about the parsec library see,
http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html

- Parsec has a lot of built in parsers like ```string```, ```char```, ```digit```, ```letter``` etc.
